# glBlocks

This is a voxel engine I've been working on to advance my knowledge in OpenGL. For now features only camera movement and procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise. Currently uses OpenGL 4.6 Core-profile.

## Planned features

- Breaking and placing of blocks
- Day/night cycle
- Multithreaded chunk generation and loading
- Chunk persistence between application runs (stored as files)
- Fog and lighting effects

The libraries that I used are:

- [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for loading the necessary OpenGL functions
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for image loading
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for mathematical types and operations
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for UI overlay elements

## Controls

- WASD - Movement
- Right click (Hold) - Pan camera
- Left shift (Hold) - Accelerate movement
- Left ctrl (Hold) - Downward movement

## Build instructions

Simply run genproj.bat which will generate the necessary project files for Visual Studio 2022. For now I'm only sup
